# Overview

This project started when I was learning about raytracing through this awesome book: [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley. We are creating the Ray Tracing renderer using the PPM image file format because it's one of the easiest formats to work with. \

The problem is Windows does not support viewing PPM files out of the box. I wanted to create a quick way to load and view a PPM file without needing to install any external applications. This web application was made to solve this problem and it is fast and light-weight.

# Features
- Load PPM image files by using the file browser or drag and drop
- Input validation that provides meaningful error messages
- Shrink or magnify images (can choose whether to maintain aspect ratio)
- Save the image as a PNG

Here is a PPM file that you can try out: https://www.dropbox.com/s/aa2s8cxa2omrnqy/image.ppm?dl=0

# Notes
This project could have been done without React, but it is one of the most popular front-end web development frameworks at the moment. I wanted to use this opportunity to practice using this framework.
